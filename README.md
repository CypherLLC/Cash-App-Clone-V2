[Scarlet Repository](https://github.com/ScarletApp/Install-Scarlet-iOS?tab=readme-ov-file) for instructions on how to install.

## App Refresh

- Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days. After 7 days, the app will no longer open (you'll see an error that says app is no longer available).
- In order to refresh the app, you must connect your phone to your Mac/PC (via USB or Wi-fi) and reinstall it (repeat the installation process).
- DO NOT delete the current app or you will lose all app's data.
